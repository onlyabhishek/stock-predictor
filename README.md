#stock predictor

This project aims to predict the closing price of stocks and provide a trading strategy (buy, sell, or hold) based on historical stock data. The input data consists of stock price information with the following attributes: open price, date, and a unique identifier.

## Data

The dataset for this project should be organized with the following columns:

- `Date`: The date of the stock price data point.
- `Open`: The opening price of the stock on that date.
- `ID`: A unique identifier for each stock entry.
- `Close`: The actual closing price of the stock on that date (for training purposes).

You will use the `Open`, `Date`, and `ID` columns to predict the `Close` price. You can obtain stock data from various sources such as financial APIs or historical stock price datasets.

## Prediction Model

This project employs a machine learning model to predict stock closing prices. You can choose from a variety of predictive models such as linear regression, time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM), or machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost). The choice of model may depend on the characteristics of your dataset and specific requirements.

### Example Model Training Pipeline

Here's an example of a model training pipeline:

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and normalize the features.

2. Feature Engineering: Create additional features if necessary, such as moving averages or technical indicators.

3. Model Selection: Choose a suitable model for your task, and split the data into training and testing sets.

4. Model Training: Train the selected model using the training data.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize performance.

7. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model for stock price predictions.

## Trading Strategy

Based on the predicted closing prices, you can implement a simple trading strategy to decide whether to buy, sell, or hold the stock. This can be done using various trading strategies, including:

- **Moving Average Crossover:** Buy when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, and sell when it crosses below.

- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** Buy when RSI crosses above a certain threshold, and sell when it crosses below another threshold.

- **Bollinger Bands:** Buy when the stock price touches the lower Bollinger Band and sell when it touches the upper Bollinger Band.

Your trading strategy can be customized to fit your specific goals and risk tolerance.
